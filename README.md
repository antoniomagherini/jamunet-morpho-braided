## Repository structure

The structure of this repository is the following:
- <code>benchmarks</code>, contains modules and notebooks of the benchmark models used for comparison;
- <code>data</code>, contains raw data (satellite images, river variables);
- <code>images</code>, contains the images shown in the thesis report and other documents; (to be added soon)
- <code>model</code>, contains the modules and noteboooks with the deep-learning model;
- <code>other</code>, contains documents, images, and other files used during the project;
- <code>postprocessing</code>, contains the modules used for the data postprocessing;
- <code>preliminary</code>, contains the notebooks with the preliminary data analysis, satellite image visualization, preprocessing steps, and other examples;
- <code>preprocessing</code>, contains the modules used for the data preprocessing.

## Install dependencies

<code>braided.yml</code> is the environment file with all dependencies, needed to run the notebooks.

To activate the environment follow these steps:

- make sure to have the file <code>braided.yml</code> in your system (for Windows users, store it in <code>C:\Windows\System32</code>);
- open the anaconda prompt;
- run <code>conda env create -f braided.yml</code>;
- verify that the environment is correctly installed by running <code>conda env list</code> and checking the environment exists;
- activate the environment by running <code>conda activate braided</code>;
- deactivate the environment by running <code>conda deactivate</code>;
